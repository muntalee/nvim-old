# notice!!!

this is my old config that uses [packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim), you can checkout the new config [here](https://github.com/muntalee/dotfiles/tree/master/.config/nvim) 
under my [dotfiles](https://github.com/muntalee/dotfiles) repo, which is up to date, and is currently using [lazy](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) as my plugin manager.
